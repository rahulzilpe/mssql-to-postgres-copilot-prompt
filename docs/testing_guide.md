# Testing Guide for SQL Server to PostgreSQL Conversion

This document provides guidelines for testing converted functions and procedures from SQL Server to PostgreSQL. Proper testing ensures that the conversion process maintains the integrity and functionality of the original SQL Server code.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**: 
   - Create unit tests for each conversion function to verify that the output matches the expected PostgreSQL syntax and behavior.
   - Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha to automate the testing process.

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the converted functions and procedures in a PostgreSQL environment to ensure they execute correctly.
   - Validate that the results of the converted code match the expected outcomes based on the original SQL Server logic.

3. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Simulate real-world scenarios by running the entire application with the converted PostgreSQL code.
   - Ensure that all components interact correctly and that the application behaves as expected.

## Test Case Development

1. **Identify Test Cases**:
   - List all functions and procedures that have been converted.
   - For each function or procedure, identify edge cases, typical use cases, and error scenarios.

2. **Create Sample Data**:
   - Develop sample datasets that cover various scenarios, including typical inputs, boundary conditions, and invalid inputs.

3. **Expected Results**:
   - Define the expected results for each test case based on the original SQL Server behavior.

## Testing Converted Functions

1. **Parameter Combinations**:
   - Test all possible combinations of input parameters to ensure the function handles them correctly.

2. **NULL Handling**:
   - Verify that the function correctly handles NULL values and returns the expected results.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test edge cases, such as empty strings, maximum/minimum values, and unexpected data types.

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Assess the performance of the converted functions to ensure they meet acceptable standards.

## Testing Converted Procedures

1. **Execution Flow**:
   - Ensure that the execution flow of the converted procedure matches the original SQL Server procedure.

2. **Transaction Handling**:
   - Test the transaction handling to confirm that it behaves as expected in PostgreSQL.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Validate that the procedure correctly handles errors and exceptions.

## Documentation and Reporting

1. **Document Test Cases**:
   - Maintain a record of all test cases, including the input data, expected results, and actual results.

2. **Report Issues**:
   - Log any discrepancies or issues encountered during testing for further investigation and resolution.

3. **Continuous Testing**:
   - Implement continuous testing practices to ensure that any future changes to the conversion logic do not introduce new issues.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a thorough testing process for your SQL Server to PostgreSQL conversions, leading to reliable and efficient database applications.
