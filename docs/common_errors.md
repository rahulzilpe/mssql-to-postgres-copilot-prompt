# Common Conversion Errors and Solutions

1. **Type mismatch in RETURNS TABLE**: If you encounter "structure of query does not match function result type" errors, ensure that your SELECT statements explicitly cast the returned columns to match the function's declared return types.

2. **Handling empty strings vs NULLs**: Be aware that PostgreSQL treats empty strings and NULLs differently than SQL Server. Use the `COALESCE` function to handle both cases effectively.

3. **String splitting**: Replace SQL Server's table-valued functions for string splitting with PostgreSQL's `string_to_array()` function for better performance and compatibility.

4. **Date handling**: Date and time functions and formats differ significantly between SQL Server and PostgreSQL. Always test date manipulations thoroughly to avoid unexpected results.

5. **Transaction handling**: PostgreSQL has different transaction isolation levels and behaviors compared to SQL Server. Ensure that your transaction logic is adapted accordingly.
